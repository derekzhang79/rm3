## rm2

I started on Rm2 in early 2011, once I had a few too many aborted efforts into refactoring the questionable design decisions from 2004 and wanted some stuff to speed up my learning of how node.js worked.  There are several classes that exist solely as direct ports of the Ruby version of the object, but using JavaScript idioms instead.

## rm

I started on Rm around October 2004.  It became functional at the start of 2005, but I went through various rewrites and distractions and didn't actually launch it until Oct 2007.  It's been running in production ever since.
